Hello Folks,
I am ARIN YADAV and YASH KAUSHIK students of NATIONAL INSTITUE OF TECHNOLOGY AGARTALA are here with a basic and simple 
project of path finder based on data structures and algorithms. It gives you broad idea how to implement DSA in real life.


This C++ code implements real time use case of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from source to every destination.
There are 30 metro stations in Jaipur. Considering each station an integer value starting from 0 is assigned,
when the user enters the source station Dijkstras algorithm is applied and least no of stations from the source to every destination station is calculated and displayed.
There is also use of graph also.

You can use following videos(links) and refer to my code to implement the same.....
